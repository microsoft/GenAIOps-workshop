# Exercise 01 - Introduction to LLMs and Azure AI Services

##  Scenario

In this exercise, we will provide an overview of how to use Azure AI to work with large language models (LLMs) tailored for Lamna Healthcare Company. Given Lamnaâ€™s recent shift from AWS and the failed Sagemaker implementation, this exercise aims to familiarize the team with the basics of Azure AI services and how they can be leveraged to meet their unique needs.

The focus will be on understanding the overall process of creating, evaluating, and deploying LLMs within the Azure environment. This foundational knowledge will be crucial as we delve deeper into the build, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring processes in subsequent lessons.

By the end of this exercise, you as part of the Lamna team will have a solid understanding of the basic tools and services available in Azure AI Studio.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Bootstrap your project.
* Use AzureAI Studio Playground.
* Work with an Open Source LLM Model.
* Test the prompt in Content Safety.

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes

## Azure AI Resource  
   
The Azure AI Resource is the main Azure resource for AI Studio. It provides a working environment for teams to build and manage AI applications. It allows access to multiple Azure AI services in a single setup and includes features for billing, security configuration, and monitoring.  
   
## Azure AI projects  
   
Azure AI projects are organizational containers that provide tools for AI customization and orchestration. They allow you to organize your work, save state across different tools (such as prompt flow), and collaborate with others. Projects also help you keep track of billing, manage access, and provide data isolation.  
   
## Azure AI Service  
   
The Azure AI Service offers a unified endpoint and API Keys to access multiple services, such as Azure OpenAI, Content Safety, Speech, and Vision. These services are shared across all projects, providing a centralized and efficient way to access them.  
   
## Storage Account  
   
The Storage Account stores artifacts for your projects, such as flows and evaluations. To ensure data isolation, storage containers are prefixed using the project GUID, and they are conditionally secured for the project identity.  
   
## Key Vault  
   
The Key Vault is used to store secrets, such as connection strings for your resource connections. To maintain data isolation, secrets cannot be retrieved across projects via APIs, ensuring the security of your sensitive information.  
   
## Container Registry  
   
The Container Registry stores Docker images that are created when using the custom runtime for prompt flow. To ensure data isolation, Docker images are prefixed using the project GUID, allowing for easy identification and management.  
   
## Application Insights  
   
Application Insights is used as a log storage option when you choose to enable application-level logging for your deployed prompt flows. It provides a centralized location to store and analyze logs for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.  
   
## Log Analytics Workspaces  
   
Log Analytics Workspaces serve as the backing storage for application insights, handling log ingestion. They provide a scalable and reliable solution for storing and analyzing log data from your AI applications.
