# Task 03 - Test the prompt in Content Safety

## Introduction

Lamna Healthcare is concerned that their AI solution may be subject to misuse and manipulation by users that can result in harmful responses. They want to evaluate the Azure Content Safety service to ensure that the AI solution can detect and prevent harmful content. Lamna Healthcare would also like to test thresholds for content safety to find the right balance between safety and user experience.

## Description

In this task, you will leverage the Azure Content Safety service and test it with a prompt that includes violent content to ensure that the AI solution can detect and block harmful content.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Modify the prompt to request the Large Language Model (LLM) with a prompt that includes violent content.

2. Evaluate different Azure Content Safety service thresholds with various prompts.

## Success Criteria

##### 1) Discover Content Safety

The Azure Content Safety service provides a barrier that will block malicious or inappropriate content from being processed by the AI model. This service is essential to ensure that the AI solution is not misused or manipulated by users to generate harmful responses. Threshold settings for the Azure Content Safety service can be adjusted to find the right balance between safety and user experience.

1. In [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com), select the **AI Services** option from the left side menu. Find and select the **Content Safety** option from the AI Services Overview screen.
