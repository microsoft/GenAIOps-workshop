# Exercise 02 - Building LLMs Orchestration Flows

## Scenario

In this exercise, the focus will be on creating and associating a conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flow with your already created model(s). This is particularly important for Lamna Healthcare Company, as it aims to enhance the performance and relevance of their 24/7 support virtual agent.

By the end of this exercise, Lamnaâ€™s team will have a functional RAG flow integrated with their GPT-4 model, setting a strong foundation for further enhancements and refinements in subsequent lessons.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Set up VSCode in AI Studio  
* Load the Vector Index  
* Modify the prompt  
* Test the prompt  
* Test the flow  
* Debug the flow  

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 75 minutes
